  <p>&amp; Hello world. This is my first website!</p>
  <h1>Quick Intro to Thomas Boller</h1>
  <p>I have been in the military, both the Army and the Air Force, for the past 11 years.  I previously worked as police and EMT, however I decided I wanted to
  get out of the emergency world. I found myself going into the world of technology about a year ago, and I have found I enjoy programming quite alot. This is my first venture 
  into the world of web development.</p>
